<h1>How to Propose a Tutorial?</h1>

<p>First of all, thank you considering giving a tutorial in PyCon Taiwan 2019.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, Good tutorials possess most of the traits good talks have. The most discernible differences of a tutorial from a <a href="{{ speaking_talk_url }}">talk</a> are the <em>hands-on</em> nature and the <em>longer duration</em>, and it's <em>paid</em>. By longer duration, generally more content is required and it should remain interesting and keep the attendees awake and hyped even after hours of lecture and exercises. By containing hands-on exercises, experience of teaching coding to people is necessary. You might also need teaching assistants who you should be able to comfortably communicate during the tutorial, usually at least two teaching assistants for a general class size of 20 people is needed.</p>

<p>Both differences requires many times of practice and experience.  Therefore, a tutorial speaker usually satisfies at least one of the following prerequisites:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A previous tutorial speaker in any programming conferences or communities</li>
	<li>More than one time of speaking experience in open source communities, preferably the local Python communities</li>
	<li>Teaching assistant in previous tutorials</li>
</ul>

<p>We might ask you to give the tutorial to the community prior to the conference if you lack the experience.</p>


<h2>Tutorial Duration</h2>

<p>Tutorials can have length of one of the below two:</p>
<ul>
  <li>3 hours, i.e. a half-day tutorial</li>
  <li>6 hours, i.e. a full-day tutorial</li>
</ul>

<p>In our previous experiences, tutorials with length of 6 hours are exhausted for both instructors and students, students usually find it difficult to consistently follow in the second half of the tutorial.  Full-day tutorials require relatively experienced instructor, thus we strongly recommend you to propose a 3-hour-long half-day tutorial, and clearly define <em>prerequisites</em> and <em>goals</em>, which helps building the best learning experience.</p>


<h2>Tutorial Dates and Location</h2>

<p>All tutorials are on-site, that is, during the conference dates, at the conference venue, in parallel with the conference.  The classroom is at R4 room (capacity of roughly 30 persons) of the venue.</p>

<p>It is also possible to give tutorials off-site, which is not during the conference dates. In that case, please note your preference in the Supplementary section of your proposal and <a href="mailto:organizers@pycon.tw">contact us</a> directly.</p>


<h2>Charging Policy</h2>

<p>The on-site tutorials have a more complicated charging policy, the orginisation team haven't make a conclusion yet.  If you want to learn about charging policy and related details earlier, please <a href="mailto:organizers@pycon.tw">contact us directly</a>.</p>

<p>Note that the tutorials are subject to cancellation if enrollment is low (usually under 8), thus the accepted tutorial proposals are not guaranteed to be held.</p>


<h2>How to become a tutorial speaker?</h2>

<p>The easiest and the best answer: Go speak and involved at the local Python communities!</p>
