					<p>Artificial Intelligence has become overwhelming popular in recent years thanks to availability of big data and the advance of machine learning based models. Among them, solutions based on the Deep Neural Network (or DNN) have produced tremendous success in various applications including computer vision, natural language processing, etc. Nevertheless, one common concern for DNN-based solutions is that they are generally very complicated and can hardly be understood by human beings. This talk focuses on a specific type of deep neural networks called recurrent neural networks (RNN). It will not only demonstrate the power of an RNN model to learn from implicit information but also explain why the overwhelming performance can be achieved given its architecture.</p>

					<p>Not everyone who learns Python is using it to become a back-end programmer. In this keynote, Tracy will cover her process on how she learned how to program and how she uses Python and programming in her current work, as well as why programming education can (and should) change considering all the ways we can use Python and programming in 2019.</p>

					<p>The programmatic availability of basically any kind of (financial) data has reshaped finance from a theory-driven to a data-driven discipline. Recent advances in AI in combination with the programmatic availability of (financial) data with further change finance to an AI-first discipline. The talk discusses several important aspects in this regard and provides concrete examples in Python.</p>
