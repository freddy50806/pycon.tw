<h1>History of PyCon Taiwan</h1>
<p> In 2008 and 2011, thinker organized PyCTW, the predecessor of PyCon Taiwan. At that time, PyCon was only an one-day event to keep Pythonistas together. (<a href="http://wiki.python.org.tw/PycTW2008" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PyCTW 2008</a>, <a href="http://wiki.python.org.tw/PycTW2011" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PyCTW 2011</a>）</p>

<p>In 2012, yyc and volunteers from communities founded the first PyCon TW. The speeches were mainly about scientific computation as well as some introductions of Python-based tools. Since the first PyCon TW, the organizers have decided to follow the <a href="http://jessenoller.com/2011/05/25/pycon-everybody-pays/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Everybody Pays</a> policy from PyCon US. That is, everyone, including the staffs and speakers of PyCon TW, is required to pay the ticket. First year of PyCon TW successfully attracted 250 audiences, which reached the maximum number of attendees. The chairperson, yyc, cheerfully recorded this milestone in <a href="http://yyc.solvcon.net/writing/2012/pycontw2012_finale.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his blog</a>.</p>

<p>In 2013, the reappointed chairperson, yyc, decided to expand the scale of PyCon TW and try several new events. For example, collaborated with caterpillar to host an paid Python tutorial before the conference. The tutorial was highly successful that many people came to ask if additional tutorials could be opened. Besides, it was the first time that the so-call night market activities, where communities hosted their own booths while attendees enjoyed the buffet with live music performance, were introduced to BoF (Birds of a Feather) event. These new events later became signature for PyCon TW. yyc summarized his thoughts about this year in <a href="http://yyc.solvcon.net/writing/2013/after_pycontw_2013/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his blog</a> as well.</p>

<p>In 2014, PyCon TW got the chance to host PyCon APAC/Taiwan. Tim Hsu was the chairperson of 2014. The slogan of 2014 was "from everything import python". A competition of problem solving in Python was launched in collaboration with <a href="http://www.checkio.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CheckIO</a>. Also, apart from the speeches, Show Time and Job Event were organized for promoting sponsors.</p>

<p>In 2015, PyCon TW was responsible for PyCon APAC/Taiwan again. The chairperson of 2015 was Keith Yang. Since in the movie <q>Back to the Future II</q>, the arrival time of Marty's time travel to the future was 2015, the slogan of that year was "Back to __future__ II". The topics mainly focused on how to practice ideas via Python and apply Python in different research fields. Several tutorials, ranging from Python introduction, to web crawling, data mining, signal processing, and even the interaction with Raspberry Pi. At the end of the event, a live Bingo game was made for the lucky draw time. Combing with web programming, attendees were able to see their Bingo number and gaming status on their phone. The attendees were excited when the conditions of getting new lines from numbers got more and more weird.</p>

<p>We passed the APAC flag to South Korea in 2016, and put our focus back to the native Taiwanese community. But PyCon Taiwan, now under the slogan “Implement the Future, Together!”, was strong as ever, and received a overwhelming amount of proposals and participants. We were lucky to invite jserv and Audrey Tang, both famous Taiwanese community leaders and established hackers, as the first ever Taiwanese keynote speakers in PyCon Taiwan. Paul Hildebrandt, senior engineer at Disney Animation Studio, brought us an enlightening speech about how Python is applied to animation production in Disney, which the audience greatly enjoyed. We also made new attempts including a FinTech session, interactive games combining sensor technology and a vending machine, and experience-sharing talks about teaching programming to young adults. The <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pycon_tw/albums">photo albums</a> have our most tresurous memories.</p>

<p>2017 is our most futuristic PyCon Taiwan ever. All of our keynote speakers, including globally renowed machine-learning expert Hsuan-Tien Lin, are not only recognized in their repective fields, but also community leaders, trend-setters, and visionaries for the next generation. In line with the community-focused theme, we also held an unconference session for the first time, looking forward to spurring discussion in the community, to great success. The late-night party is also expanded to include contributions from community members with great talent. Adrian Liaw’s piano performance was such a treat.</p>

<p>The largely same team were brought back to host PyCon Taiwan in 2018. Continuing the established theme, the image is set to “acceletation”, both in the technical sense and community-wise. Join and accelerate with us!</p>
