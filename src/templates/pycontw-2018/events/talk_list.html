<h1>{% trans 'Talks' %}</h1>

<article>
	<p>{% blocktrans trimmed %}The two conference days are packed with talks about Python by speakers from Taiwan and around the world. The talks will be either 30- or 45-minute long. Three tracks of talks will be delivered simultaneously, all with different topics and difficulties. We suggest you to make a schedule beforehand, and choose what you want ot listen based on your interests. Many people take notes on the program schedule before the meeting so they don't end up in some place wrong.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
